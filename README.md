# Colorization Models

This repository contains PyTorch implementations of two colorization models: ECCV16 and SIGGRAPH17. These models can be used to automatically add color to grayscale images.

## Models

- **ECCV16**: This model is based on the ECCV 2016 paper and provides colorization using a deep neural network architecture.

- **SIGGRAPH17**: This model is based on the SIGGRAPH 2017 paper and offers an alternative approach to colorization.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pillow
- scikit-image

### Usage

1. Load an input grayscale image.
2. Use one of the provided colorization models to generate a colorized version of the image.
3. Displays the original grayscale image, the input image, and the colorized output image.
